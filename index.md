  <h1>Unfetter</h1>
  <p>Unfetter is a project designed to help network defenders, cyber security professionals, and decision makers identify and analyze defensive gaps in a more scalable and repeatable way. By featuring the groups<a href="#footnote1" id="footnote1_src"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and techniques<a href="#footnote2" id="footnote2_src"><sup>[2]</sup></a> of the <a href="{{site.attack_url}}">ATT&amp;CK</a>&trade; model combined with the analytics<a href="#footnote3" id="footnote3_src"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, data model<a href="#footnote4" id="footnote4_src"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and sensors<a href="#footnote5" id="footnote5_src"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the <a href="{{site.car_url}}">Cyber Analytics Repository</a> (CAR), Unfetter offers an opportunity for the community to come together and move beyond indicators toward a behavioral-based methodology.</p>

      <a name="footnote1" href="#footnote1_src">1</a>: Groups refer to adversaries who may conduct campaigns. They may also be commonly referred to as campaigns or intrusion sets.<br />
      <a name="footnote2" href="#footnote2_src">2</a>: Techniques refer to the ATT&amp;CK techniques.  A technique is a name to define post-access adversary behavior.<br />
      <a name="footnote3" href="#footnote3_src">3</a>: Analytics refer to pseudocode written to assist computer network defenders in identifying post-access adversary behavior in an environment.<br />
      <a name="footnote4" href="#footnote4_src">4</a>: Data model refers to a common nomenclature in CAR to define the objects, actions, and fields necessary to link analytics to sensors.<br />
      <a name="footnote5" href="#footnote5_src">5</a>: Sensors refer to host-based open source or commercially available software or hardware that can be used in combination with analytics to identify post-access adversary behavior.
